# `Comparison_diff_types_of_camb_non_lin_powspec`
As of October 2020, CAMB offers four choices for power spectrum,

-   Linear
-   Non-linear Matter Power (HALOFIT)
-   Non-linear CMB Lensing (HALOFIT)
-   Non-linear Matter Power and CMB Lensing (HALOFIT)

This code tests the output corresponding to each of these options. It also tests the `Do21cm` option.
