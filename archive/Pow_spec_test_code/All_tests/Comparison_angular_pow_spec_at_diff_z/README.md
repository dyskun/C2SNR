# `Comparison_angular_pow_spec_at_diff_z`

At this stage, I was very confused about the difference in the results obtained by integration over redshift in the expression of convergence angular power spectrum. 

For reference: See equation 20 of Pourtsidou et al. 2014 (`/references/pourtsidou_2014.pdf`) and equation 21 of Zahn and Zaldarriaga 2006 (`/references/zahn_zald_2006.pdf`). 

The factor of c^2 in the denominator of eq 21 in Zahn and Zaldarriaga 2006 is likely a typo. It should be c^3.
