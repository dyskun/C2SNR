# `Comparison_lin_nonlin_angpowspec`

This code compares the angular power spectrum produced using linear and non-linear matter power spectrum.

NOTE (Oct 2, 2020): This coded uses the `cd.angular_diameter_distance` to find distance between the source and the lens. I and Girish discussed and decided to not use `angular_diameter_distance` in our calculations and to use `comoving_distance` instead.
