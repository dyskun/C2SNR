# `Proper_distance_ang_dia_distance`
To find the variation of the proper and comoving distance between a source and an observer. 

Most probably this code is conceptually wrong! See the "Distances in Cosmology" paper by David hogg. Angular diameter has a different meaning than what I have taken here.
