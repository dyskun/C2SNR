Aim: 
-   To plot the [CII] line intensity as a function of redshift. 

Procedure:
-   Use XYScan to read data points from the top panel of Figure 1 in the attached paper.
-   Use this data and equation 5 to find `f_star()`
-   Use the `SFR - M_halo` relation in equation 6 to find the `L_[CII] - M_halo` relation
-   Use this in equation 7 and finally reproduce the bottom panel of figure 1.
