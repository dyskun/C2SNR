    abstract = "{We study how 21 cm intensity mapping can be used to measure gravitational lensing over a wide range of redshift. This can extend weak lensing measurements to higher redshifts than are accessible with conventional galaxy surveys. We construct a convergence estimator taking into account the discreteness of galaxies and calculate the expected noise level as a function of redshift and telescope parameters. At z ∼ 2–3, we find that a telescope array with a collecting area ∼0.2 km2 spread over a region with diameter ∼2 km would be sufficient to measure the convergence power spectrum to high accuracy for multipoles between 10 and 1000. We show that these measurements can be used to constrain interacting dark energy models.}",

    abstract = "{We study the constraints which the next generation of radio telescopes could place on the nature of dark energy, dark matter and inflation by studying the gravitational lensing of high redshift 21 m emission, and we compare with the constraints obtainable from wide-angle surveys of galaxy lensing. If the reionization epoch is effectively at z∼ 8 or later, very large amounts of cosmological information will be accessible to telescopes like Square Kilometer Array (SKA) and Low Frequency Array (LOFAR). We use simple characterizations of reionization history and of proposed telescope designs to investigate how well the two-dimensional convergence power spectrum, the three-dimensional matter power spectrum, the evolution of the linear growth function and the standard cosmological parameters can be measured from radio data. The power spectra can be measured accurately over a wide range of wavenumbers at z∼ 2, and the evolution in the cosmic energy density can be probed from z∼ 0.5 to 7. This results in a characterization of the shape of the power spectra (i.e. of the nature of dark matter and of inflationary structure generation) which is potentially more precise than that obtained from galaxy lensing surveys. On the other hand, the dark energy parameters in their conventional parametrization (ΩΛ, wo, wa) are somewhat less well constrained by feasible 21 cm lensing surveys than by an all-sky galaxy lensing survey. This is because dark energy is felt primarily at relatively low redshifts in this model; 21 cm surveys would be more powerful than galaxy surveys for constraining models with ‘early’ dark energy. Overall, the best constraints come from combining surveys of the two types. This results in extremely tight constraints on dark matter and inflation, and improves constraints on dark energy, as judged by the standard figure of merit, by more than an order of magnitude over either survey alone.}",

	title = {Cosmological Parameter Estimation Using 21 cm Radiation from the Epoch of Reionization},
	journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
	abstract = {A number of radio interferometers are currently being planned or constructed to observe 21 cm emission from reionization. Not only will such measurements provide a detailed view of that epoch, but, since the 21 cm emission also traces the distribution of matter in the universe, this signal can be used to constrain cosmological parameters. The sensitivity of an interferometer to the cosmological information in the signal may depend on how precisely the angular dependence of the 21 cm three-dimensional power spectrum can be measured. Using an analytic model for reionization, we quantify all the effects that break the spherical symmetry of the three-dimensional 21 cm power spectrum. We find that upcoming observatories will be sensitive to the 21 cm signal over a wide range of scales, from larger than 100 to as small as 1 comoving Mpc. Next, we consider three methods to measure cosmological parameters from the signal: (1) direct fitting of the density power spectrum to the signal, (2) using only the velocity field fluctuations in the signal, and (3) looking at the signal at large enough scales that all fluctuations trace the density field. With the foremost method, the first generation of 21 cm observations should moderately improve existing constraints on cosmological parameters for certain low-redshift reionization scenarios, and a 2 yr observation with the second-generation interferometer MWA5000 in combination with the CMB telescope Planck could improve constraints on Ωw, Ωmh2, Ωbh2, Ων, ns, and αs. If the universe is substantially ionized by z ~ 12 or if spin temperature fluctuations are important, we show that it will be difficult to place competitive constraints on cosmological parameters with any of the considered methods.}
